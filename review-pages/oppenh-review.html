                    This movie is by no means a masterpiece.
                    <br>
                    It has every intention of being that, Nolan doesn't do anything without very high aspirations, 
                    but I think it goes too grand, cumbersome, uncomfortable, and I would even say pretentious.
                    Nolan uses all the tricks to make it seem like a great work: 3 hours long, black and white sequences, 
                    very close shots, hyper-forceful sound effects, brutal cast, difficult to follow script, endless sequences, 
                    the occasional stark nudity ... but it doesn't work.<br><br>
                    Too much dialogue, too many characters, a rushed progression of events and constant jumps in time do not allow us to feel anything for the protagonists or for what is happening, 
                    and the whole ends up stunning and uncomfortable.
                    <br>
                    It is a story worth telling, but not in this reverified way. I didn't like it at all, much less it seems like the masterpiece that all the media is already talking about. 
                    I give it 3 stars because it is very important as a message for new generations. But as a movie... meh.</p>

                    I'll be brief, I loved it.<br>
                    But to be honest it is far from perfect, I feel that Nolan could have done a better job with the pacing and editing, 
                    but other than that it is a film that shines in many things that other directors would not achieve with the same budget, 
                    from the aspect introspective to the most epic, it is a great film, perhaps a little exhaustive for a more casual audience.</p>
