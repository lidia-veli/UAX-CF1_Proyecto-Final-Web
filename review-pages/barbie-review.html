                <p class="comment-content">This movie is marvelous. An ode to femininity with a feminist message that will move and raise awareness among many people, which in turn also serves as self-help to get rid of toxic masculinity, stigmas, stereotypes and gender roles.
                    The aesthetics are impressive and the soundtrack is not far behind. It's almost two hours of footage that goes by as quickly as an episode of an average series.
                    Without a doubt one of my favorite movies of this year and one that I will watch over and over again for the rest of my life.
                    I want Greta Gerwig directing many more films.</p>

                    I ESPECIALLY LIKED the production design and the recreation of Barbie's world, highlighting the initial sequences in which a certain scene on a famous monolith is honored, 
                    as well as when it describes what a day in Barbie's world is like. 
                    Also the performances of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (laughing out loud at himself, although the numerous mentions in which he is nominated for the Oscars seem very exaggerated to me),
                    America Ferrera and that speech between confession and liberation in one of the top moments of the film and the role of Will Ferrell, although it constantly reminded me of his role in the Lego Movie.  
                    <br><br>
                    I DID NOT LIKE AT ALL: The way of narrating how Ken becomes aware of the real world;
                     too simple... It seems to me a tremendous mistake not to go deeper into the mother-daughter relationship, 
                     assuming that the daughter "is angry because she is a teenager" and that's it! By the way, the character of the girl contributes very little 
                     to the film and in which we forget to know how she goes from not communicating with her mother to sharing this surreal adventure in Barbieland. 
                     Another completely flat character who could have contributed much more is the "Weird Barbie.".</p>
